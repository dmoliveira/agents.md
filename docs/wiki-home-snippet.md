## AGENTS.md Playbook for Parallel Delivery

This project documents a practical `AGENTS.md` contract for teams running AI agents in parallel.

- Start here: [README](https://github.com/dmoliveira/agents.md)
- Operating contract: [AGENTS.md](https://github.com/dmoliveira/agents.md/blob/main/AGENTS.md)
- Tooling quick reference: [docs/tooling-quick-ref.md](https://github.com/dmoliveira/agents.md/blob/main/docs/tooling-quick-ref.md)
- Advanced orchestration: [docs/orchestration-advanced.md](https://github.com/dmoliveira/agents.md/blob/main/docs/orchestration-advanced.md)
- Support this work: [docs/support-the-project.md](https://github.com/dmoliveira/agents.md/blob/main/docs/support-the-project.md)

Key behavior:
- Use dedicated worktrees per task.
- Keep commits small and focused.
- End cycles with `<CONTINUE-LOOP>` when tasks remain.
```
