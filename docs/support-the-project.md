# Support the Project

If this repository helps your team run agents with more clarity and less coordination overhead, you can support maintenance and future open projects.

## Ways to support

- GitHub Sponsors: https://github.com/sponsors/dmoliveira
- Open issues with reproducible examples and clear acceptance criteria
- Improve docs and onboarding pages (`README.md`, `AGENTS.md`, `docs/`)
- Share implementation patterns that worked well in production teams

## Why support matters

Support helps fund:
- documentation updates and workflow improvements,
- examples for multi-agent orchestration,
- better defaults for safer, faster delivery loops.

Thank you for helping keep this practical and useful for everyone.
